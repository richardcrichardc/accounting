# Various Personal Accounting Projects

Here are a couple of personal accounting programs I have written and used over the years.

## timesheets

I have worked as a freelancer doing most work on an hourly basis, so I needed something for recording work done and generating invoices. This is a Python program using GTK to provide a UI for recording timesheets. Data is stored in a SQLite database. It generates PDF invoices. I had customers both in New Zealand and the United Kingdom so it supports multiple currencies and sales taxes.

## double-entry

Some years back I had a rental property and needed to keep detailed books. The perfect excuse to write my own double-entry accounting package, and for a reason that now eludes me I wrote it in C. This is in the vein of 'plain text accounting' which has become popular recently.
